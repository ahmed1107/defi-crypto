		  <p>If you are willing to take risks, then Yield Farming could be something for you. Yield farming is a simple technique used to increase your tokens with tokens you already own. It is known as defi (decentralised finance). One of the best chains for yield farming is the Binance Smart Chain, which uses the BNB token.</p>
<p>For example, if you yield farm on a site and chain specialising in digital assets operating on the Binance smart chain, transactions will be cheaper than if you yield farm on Ethereum or a layer 2. The transactions you pay for will be in BNB, but the rewards you receive can be another token or BNB itself.</p>
<h3>Yield Farming on Binance Smart Chain with liquidity.</h3>
<p>It is possible to engage in yield farming using many methods. One of the most common methods is to provide liquidity to a decentralised exchange (DEX) and then farm the tokens that the DEX issues to you</p>
<p>For example, you might want to add liquidity to a DEX such as Pancakeswap. When you add liquidity, you may suffer some losses in the form of imperminent loss. That is why I like to work with stable or pegged currencies, for example BNB / WBNB or even stable currency pairs like BUSD/ USDT. The volatility in these pairs is very low.</p>
<p><img style="max-width: 100%; height: 179px; margin: 5px; float: right;" src="https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5fad86e2327507cecea2d5e8/613630a2abdb761e7c06b408_yeild-20.jpg" width="318" /></p>
<p>It is also possible to take advantage of the Proof of Stake (pos) capabilities of the Binance smart chain (bsc), so you simply stake your BNB and earn BNB as a reward for helping to secure the network with your staked tokens.</p>
<h3>What is Yield Farming in BNB!</h3>
<p>When you talk about yield farming, it has everything to do with cryptocurrencies and the defi space. The term yield farming was coined as a result of the process of actively searching for the best return on investment (ROI) in the space, with users, known as &lsquo;farmers&rsquo;, constantly looking for the &lsquo;most profitable yields&rsquo; on the defi protocols on primarily Ethereum and the Binance smart chain.</p>
<h3 id="5">Yield farming on Ethereum vs. Binance smart chain (BSC)</h3>
<p>Ethereum was the first platform to have Defi on its chain - Binance Smart Chain came after Ethereum and offers almost the same capabilities found on Ethereum, but with some important differences.</p>
<ul>
<li>All transactions are conducted with BNB</li>
<li>Transactions on the Binance smart chain are much cheaper than on Ethereum</li>
<li>Compaction on BNB can be done much more frequently due to lower fees</li>
<li>With BNB, you can make profits with much less capital</li>
<li>BNB works with Bep20 tokens, while Ethereum works with erc20</li>
</ul>
<p>And because Binance Smart Chain is cheaper, many startups opt to launch their applications on BSC, after all that's where most normal people go to farm as it's cheaper for users to use BSC with BNB.</p>
<p>Most platforms on Binance Smart Chain offer higher returns when using the platform's own tokens or more speculative assets as they need the liquidity to run their dex or amm.</p>

<h3 id="7">The Main Features of the BNB Chain</h3>
<p>Ethereum is probably the most decentralised blockchain platform, but transaction costs can be expensive. Transaction fees, which are on the order of $10, are fairly common for transactions on the Ethereum blockchain. That's why Binance created its smart chain (BSC).</p>
<p>The Binance blockchain was designed to enable the same fast transactions and greatly expand the available features and capabilities offered by Ethereum. The only real drawback to Binance is that the BNB and the BSC chain are not very decentralized. Binance limits the number of validators that can secure/verify the network (something Ethereum does not)</p>
<p>Just as you can use wallets like Meta Mask for Ethereum, you can do the same for Binace and many other EVM platforms like Fantom, Avax, Matic, Optimism and many more.</p>
<h3>Binance BSC wallets</h3>
<p>Binance, the leading cryptocurrency exchange ecosystem, has a range of wallets that work with Metamask, Trust Wallet, SafePal and many other bsc-compatible wallets. and many of them work with hardware devices such as the Ledger Nano or Trezor.</p>
<h3>BNB blockchain ecosystem.</h3>
<p>Bsc aims to increase the adoption and usage of both bnb and the binance chain by creating an ecosystem where token holders, validators, users and developers can benefit from the deployment and investment of their cryptoassets, as well as have access to growth and innovation opportunities.</p>
<h3>Yield farming on the BNB blockchain.</h3>
<p>Farmers are the users who borrow bnb from the bank. Why borrow money from the bank? By borrowing money from the bank, yield farmers can increase their positions, which increases the yield of the yield farmers' process by up to a factor of 2. What does Kalmar's Leveraged Yield Farming platform do in addition to borrowing from the bank? In addition to borrowing from the bank based on the amount of leverage chosen by the user, the smart contract also reinvests the returns received from the yield farming process along with trading commissions for more LP, steadily increasing the yield farmer's position.</p>
<p>Yes. However, it depends on how much money and effort one is willing to invest in yield farming. Certain high-risk strategies promise substantial returns, but often require a deep understanding of defi platforms, protocols and complicated investment chains to be as effective as possible.</p>
<p>Alternatively, an equally popular activity in the world of passive income is gambling. While yield farming involves providing liquidity to other users, staking is used to run a blockchain.</p>
